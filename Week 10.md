### **Perform software testing to validate code moving into production.**  

Software testing ensures that code moving into production is secure, functional, and free from vulnerabilities. This process involves various testing methods, including:  

1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Analyzes source code for vulnerabilities without executing the program. SAST helps developers identify and fix issues like SQL injection or buffer overflows during the development phase.  

2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Tests the running application to uncover vulnerabilities in the execution environment. For example, DAST might simulate attacks on a web application to detect issues like cross-site scripting (XSS).  

3. **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**: Combines elements of SAST and DAST by analyzing applications in real time during execution. This approach provides more context about vulnerabilities and their potential impact.  

Validating code before production reduces the likelihood of deploying insecure applications, protecting the organization from data breaches, performance issues, and reputational damage.  

---

### **Understand the difference between static and dynamic software testing.**  

Static and dynamic software testing are complementary approaches used to identify vulnerabilities and ensure software quality:  

1. **Static Testing**: Involves analyzing the codebase without executing the program. Tools like **SonarQube** or **Checkmarx** identify vulnerabilities early in the development cycle. Static testing is efficient for finding coding errors, adherence to standards, and potential security flaws, such as hardcoded credentials or unvalidated inputs.  

2. **Dynamic Testing**: Involves running the application in a controlled environment to identify runtime issues. Tools like **Burp Suite** or **OWASP ZAP** simulate attacks to discover vulnerabilities like insecure session handling or input validation errors.  

Static testing is proactive and cost-effective for early detection, while dynamic testing provides insights into how the application behaves under real-world conditions. Both are essential for building secure, reliable software.

### **Know the difference between need-to-know and the least privilege principle.**  

The **need-to-know** principle and the **least privilege** principle are complementary strategies in access control, designed to minimize risks associated with unauthorized access to information and system resources.  

**Need-to-Know Principle**:  
The need-to-know principle restricts access to information strictly to individuals who require it to perform their job duties. It ensures that employees only have access to the data necessary to complete specific tasks or roles. For instance, a marketing employee does not need access to financial records, and a system administrator managing backups does not need access to payroll information.  

Core practices for implementing need-to-know include:  
- **Data classification and segmentation:** Organizing information into categories to limit exposure.  
- **Role-based access controls (RBAC):** Granting access permissions based on specific job functions.  
- **Audit and review:** Regularly auditing access logs to ensure adherence to need-to-know restrictions.  

**Least Privilege Principle**:  
The least privilege principle focuses on granting users the bare minimum access rights required to perform their duties effectively. This approach not only applies to data but extends to system functionalities, administrative tools, and network services. For example, a developer needing to troubleshoot an application might be granted temporary read-only access to logs rather than full administrator privileges.  

Key components of the least privilege principle include:  
- **Time-bound access:** Granting temporary permissions for specific tasks or projects.  
- **Privileged account monitoring:** Keeping track of elevated access and revoking it when no longer needed.  
- **Separation of duties (SoD):** Ensuring critical tasks are divided among multiple personnel to avoid excessive control by a single individual.  

Together, these principles help reduce the likelihood of data breaches, accidental errors, and insider threats by limiting both the scope and extent of access within an organization.

### **Understand segregation of duties and job rotation.**  

**Segregation of Duties (SoD)** and **job rotation** are crucial practices for reducing the risks of fraud, errors, and insider threats within an organization’s operations.  

**Segregation of Duties (SoD):**  
SoD involves dividing responsibilities among multiple individuals to ensure that no single person has excessive control over critical processes or systems. This practice helps prevent conflicts of interest, unauthorized actions, and undetected errors.  

Key aspects of SoD include:  
- **Fraud prevention:** For example, separating the roles of initiating a payment and approving it ensures that no single person can process unauthorized transactions.  
- **Error reduction:** Multiple parties reviewing and verifying tasks can identify mistakes more effectively.  
- **Compliance assurance:** Segregation ensures adherence to regulatory requirements like SOX or PCI DSS.  

To implement SoD effectively:  
- Define clear roles and responsibilities.  
- Use technical controls like access restrictions to enforce segregation.  
- Conduct regular audits to confirm adherence to SoD policies.  

**Job Rotation:**  
Job rotation is the periodic reassignment of employees to different roles or responsibilities within the organization. It serves to mitigate risk and enhance operational resilience.  

Benefits of job rotation include:  
- **Fraud detection:** New employees in a role may notice irregularities overlooked by their predecessors.  
- **Skill development:** Cross-training employees fosters a more versatile workforce.  
- **Burnout reduction:** Rotating roles helps alleviate monotony and keeps employees engaged.
