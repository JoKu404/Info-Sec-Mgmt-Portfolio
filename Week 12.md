## **Understand the eDiscovery process.**

**eDiscovery** (electronic discovery) refers to the process of identifying, collecting, and reviewing electronic data for use in legal cases, particularly in civil litigation, regulatory compliance, or criminal investigations. In the context of cybersecurity, eDiscovery is often used to retrieve digital evidence following a cybercrime or to support internal investigations involving breaches of company policy.

The eDiscovery process includes several stages, such as:

1. **Identification**: Determining which electronic records, communications, and data are relevant to the case.
2. **Collection**: Gathering the identified data in a forensically sound manner to prevent alteration or destruction.
3. **Processing**: Filtering and organizing the data to make it easier to review and analyze.
4. **Review**: Assessing the data for relevance and any privileged or confidential information.
5. **Analysis**: Examining the data for patterns, anomalies, or evidence of wrongdoing.
6. **Production**: Delivering the relevant data in a format that can be presented in court or to the opposing party.

Effective eDiscovery is crucial for identifying relevant evidence, maintaining compliance, and ensuring that any legal action is based on accurate and complete information.
