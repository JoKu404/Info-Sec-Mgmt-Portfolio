## Domain 1.0: Security and Risk Management

---

### **Contributing to and Enforcing Personnel Security Policies and Procedures**

In information security and cybersecurity as a whole, people are often seen as the weakest link. This chapter emphasizes the need to develop and enforce robust personnel security policies and procedures to mitigate human risks. This includes screening, monitoring, and managing the personnel lifecycle from hiring to termination. Personnel security policies ensure that employees, contractors, and external vendors comply with security measures that protect the organization’s information and systems.

#### **Candidate Screening and Hiring**

A secure organization starts with the hiring process. **Candidate screening** involves extensive background checks, reference validation, and identity verification to ensure potential employees are trustworthy and qualified for sensitive roles. In organizations handling sensitive data, additional checks such as security clearances, criminal background investigations, and even social media screening may be performed to gauge the integrity and suitability of candidates.

Screening processes vary based on the security requirements of the job position, but the underlying goal is always the same: to prevent unqualified or potentially malicious individuals from gaining access to sensitive organizational assets. Screening efforts can include identity validation through documents like a passport or driver's license, credit checks, verification of education credentials, and a thorough review of past work experience.

---

#### **Employment Agreements and Policy-Driven Requirements**

Once hired, **employment agreements** formalize the responsibilities and security obligations of the new employee. These agreements, often including **Acceptable Use Policies (AUP)** and **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA)**, are essential in ensuring that employees understand the security expectations placed on them. The agreements outline security policies, confidentiality requirements, and penalties for violations.

A strong employment agreement ensures that employees are legally bound to adhere to organizational security policies. This protects sensitive assets from unauthorized disclosure or misuse by holding employees accountable for their actions. For critical positions, additional clauses like **Non-Compete Agreements (NCA)** may be included to protect intellectual property from exploitation by competitors.

---

#### **Onboarding, Transfers, and Termination Processes**

The **onboarding process** integrates new employees into the organization's security culture by establishing their access to systems, assigning roles, and providing them with the necessary security training. During onboarding, employees are granted specific access rights based on their job roles, and privileges are aligned with the **principle of least privilege**, ensuring that employees only access what is essential for their tasks.

Similarly, when employees transfer to new roles or departments, their access rights must be reassessed to reflect their new responsibilities. **Offboarding** procedures are equally important when an employee leaves the organization. During offboarding, access rights must be revoked, and sensitive materials like key cards, computers, and devices must be returned to prevent lingering security risks. A comprehensive offboarding ensures that former employees no longer have access to the organization's assets, safeguarding against both accidental and malicious breaches.

---

#### **Vendor, Consultant, and Contractor Agreements and Controls**

Organizations increasingly rely on **vendors, consultants, and contractors** to perform essential tasks. The risks posed by these external parties are significant, and controlling their access is crucial. The chapter emphasizes the use of **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)** and detailed contracts that outline security expectations, performance benchmarks, and consequences for security breaches.

Vendor relationships can introduce risks such as **multiparty risk**—where the goals and priorities of different organizations may not align, leading to vulnerabilities. SLAs serve as an enforceable contract between the organization and the vendor to ensure performance consistency and to hold the vendor accountable for breaches or service failures.

Furthermore, employing tools like **Vendor Management Systems (VMS)** ensures that all interactions with vendors, including their access to the organization's assets and data, are monitored, logged, and audited. This mitigates risks associated with outsourcing and ensures that third-party providers maintain the required level of security.

---

### **Understanding and Applying Risk Management Concepts**

Risk management is the cornerstone of an organization's security strategy. It involves identifying threats and vulnerabilities, assessing risks, and implementing effective countermeasures. Risk management aims to reduce potential harm to the organization's assets by selecting appropriate responses to mitigate or transfer risk.

---

#### **Threat and Vulnerability Identification**

Every organization must identify the potential **threats and vulnerabilities** that can harm its operations. Threats can arise from a variety of sources, including cyberattacks, natural disasters, and insider threats. **Vulnerability assessments** help organizations pinpoint weaknesses in their systems, whether they are technical flaws or procedural oversights. Threat agents, both internal (such as disgruntled employees) and external (like hackers), are also analyzed to determine the likelihood of an attack and its potential impact.

By identifying the ways in which their assets are exposed, organizations can better prepare for and prevent attacks.

---

#### **Risk Analysis, Assessment, and Scope**

Once threats and vulnerabilities are identified, organizations need to conduct a thorough **risk assessment** to evaluate the probability of a threat occurring and the severity of its impact. This is where both **qualitative** and **quantitative** approaches to risk come into play. Quantitative risk assessment assigns specific monetary values to risks, helping organizations make data-driven decisions regarding the implementation of security controls.

The **scope** of risk assessments can vary based on the organization's needs, but it should include all critical assets and operational processes. This analysis informs the selection of appropriate countermeasures to mitigate identified risks.

---

#### **Risk Response and Treatment**

Once risks are identified and analyzed, organizations must decide how to respond. **Risk response** options include **mitigation** (implementing controls to reduce risk), **transference** (shifting risk to another party, such as through insurance), **deterrence**, and **acceptance** (accepting certain risks as tolerable).

For example, **cybersecurity insurance** is increasingly popular as a risk transference strategy. It provides financial coverage for the costs associated with a data breach, including remediation, customer notification, and regulatory fines.

---

#### **Types of Controls: Preventive, Detective, and Corrective**

To mitigate risks, organizations employ various types of security controls. **Preventive controls** aim to stop an attack before it happens, such as firewalls and access controls. **Detective controls** identify and report on an attack in progress, using systems like intrusion detection systems (IDS). Finally, **Corrective controls** help to recover from a security incident by restoring compromised systems and data.

A layered approach that incorporates all three types of controls ensures comprehensive protection from potential threats.

---

#### **Control Assessments and Continuous Monitoring**

**Control assessments** evaluate the effectiveness of existing security measures. This process ensures that controls are functioning as intended and helps identify gaps or areas for improvement. Assessments can include security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning. **Continuous monitoring** is equally essential for detecting new threats or vulnerabilities as they emerge, providing organizations with real-time insight into their security posture.

The chapter also discusses the importance of periodic security reviews and **reporting** mechanisms, both internal and external, to maintain transparency and compliance with regulations.

---

#### **Continuous Improvement and Risk Frameworks**

Organizations must adopt a culture of **continuous improvement** to address the evolving threat landscape. This includes regular updates to security policies, procedures, and technologies to keep up with emerging threats and vulnerabilities. **Risk maturity models** provide a framework for assessing an organization’s risk management capabilities, helping them transition from reactive to proactive security practices.

Additionally, organizations rely on widely recognized **risk frameworks** such as ISO, NIST, and COBIT to structure their risk management programs and ensure compliance with industry standards.

---

### **Establishing and Maintaining a Security Awareness, Education, and Training Program**

While technical controls are crucial, a large part of securing an organization lies in training its personnel. Security awareness programs ensure that employees understand the risks they face, the importance of security protocols, and their role in protecting organizational assets. This chapter emphasizes that a well-designed training program is not a one-time event but an ongoing effort to keep personnel informed and engaged.

---

#### **Methods and Techniques for Presenting Awareness and Training**

The chapter highlights various methods for delivering effective security awareness training, including **social engineering simulations**, **phishing campaigns**, and **gamification** techniques. These methods ensure that employees are not only trained but also actively engaged in the learning process.

The use of **security champions**—employees who promote security awareness within their teams—can also help reinforce a culture of security across the organization. These champions serve as role models and provide guidance on adhering to security policies and procedures.

# Expanded Security Threats and Social Engineering Tactics

---

### **Typosquatting**

**Typosquatting** is a technique where attackers register domain names that closely resemble legitimate ones, often with minor typographical errors. For instance, if the legitimate domain is `example.com`, an attacker might register `examp1e.com` (with a numeral "1" instead of the letter "l"). Unsuspecting users may type the wrong domain by mistake, leading them to malicious websites that can harvest login credentials or install malware. An example could be going from google.com vs googIe.com

Typosquatting is particularly dangerous for brands and online services because users may trust the look-alike domain, believing it to be the authentic website. Organizations need to monitor for typosquatted domains and take legal or technical actions to minimize their impact. Google and other big companies buy the domains so malicious actors cannot.

---

### **Identity Fraud**

**Identity fraud** occurs when attackers steal personal or financial information to impersonate an individual or organization. This often involves using stolen credentials to gain access to bank accounts, email accounts, or online services, which can result in unauthorized transactions or reputation damage. Identity fraud can also occur through data breaches or phishing attacks, where attackers harvest personal details like Social Security numbers, birth dates, and credit card information.

Preventing identity fraud requires strong password policies, two-factor authentication (2FA), and awareness training for employees and customers.

---

### **Invoice Scams**

An **invoice scam** is a form of fraud where attackers impersonate legitimate vendors or suppliers, sending fake invoices to an organization requesting payment. Often, these fake invoices look genuine and may include accurate company details or past interactions to seem legitimate. The goal is to trick the recipient into paying the invoice to a fraudulent account.

To mitigate invoice scams, organizations must establish strong verification processes for any incoming invoices, ensuring that changes to payment details or new vendors are thoroughly vetted before any payments are processed.

---

### **Whaling**

**Whaling** is a form of highly targeted phishing, aimed at senior executives or high-ranking individuals within an organization, such as CEOs or CFOs. The goal is to trick these individuals into revealing sensitive information or authorizing large financial transactions. Attackers often use detailed and personalized information to make their emails seem legitimate, thus increasing the likelihood of success.

Whaling attacks are particularly dangerous due to the power and access these individuals possess. Preventing whaling requires training executives to recognize phishing attempts and implementing security measures such as multi-factor authentication and financial transaction verification procedures.

---

### **Spear Phishing**

**Spear phishing** is a more targeted version of phishing, where attackers focus on a specific individual or organization. Unlike general phishing campaigns that cast a wide net, spear phishing uses tailored messages to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. Attackers may research their targets through social media or public records to create convincing messages.

Spear phishing is a significant threat because it bypasses traditional security mechanisms by exploiting human trust. Combatting spear phishing involves training users to recognize suspicious emails, verifying unexpected requests, and using advanced email filtering technologies.

---

### **Vishing**

**Vishing** (voice phishing) involves attackers using phone calls to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or passwords. A typical vishing attack might involve a caller pretending to be from a bank or government agency, creating a sense of urgency to pressure the victim into compliance.

Vishing is often combined with other forms of social engineering, such as email or SMS-based attacks. To defend against vishing, employees should be trained to verify the legitimacy of callers and to never give out sensitive information over the phone without proper authentication.

---

### **Smishing**

**Smishing** (SMS phishing) uses text messages to trick victims into clicking malicious links or sharing personal information. Attackers may send messages that appear to come from banks, delivery services, or trusted organizations, urging recipients to take immediate action, such as updating their account information or tracking a package.

Smishing is increasingly common, as mobile phones are pervasive and users tend to trust SMS more than email. Organizations should educate users to verify messages before clicking on links and report suspicious messages.

---

### **Prepending**

**Prepending** is a tactic where attackers add misleading or malicious information at the start of a legitimate communication. For example, in an email thread, an attacker might insert fake content before a legitimate message, making it seem as though the sender endorses the attacker’s fraudulent information. Prepending is particularly effective in scenarios where email chains are long, and recipients may not scrutinize the entire thread.

Employees should be trained to carefully inspect all parts of an email chain, especially when sensitive information or financial transactions are involved.

---

## **Psychological Triggers in Social Engineering**

Social engineers frequently exploit **psychological triggers** to manipulate their victims. These triggers tap into basic human instincts, making people more likely to comply with malicious requests. Some of the most common triggers include:

---

### **Intimidation**

Attackers use **intimidation** to create fear, urgency, or panic, compelling individuals to act quickly without thinking. For example, a scammer might impersonate law enforcement or a bank, threatening legal consequences unless immediate action is taken. The victim, fearing punishment, may comply with requests for personal information or payments without verifying the legitimacy of the threat.

To counter intimidation tactics, employees and users should be encouraged to stay calm, verify threats independently, and not act impulsively when faced with urgent demands.

---

### **Consensus**

The **consensus** tactic plays on people's natural tendency to follow the behavior of others, especially when uncertain. Attackers might claim that "everyone else has done it" or that a majority of employees have already complied with a request, which can pressure the victim into doing the same. This is commonly seen in phishing emails that mimic legitimate organizational requests, like company-wide password resets.

Educating individuals about these tactics and encouraging independent verification of requests can reduce the effectiveness of consensus-based social engineering.

---

### **Scarcity**

Attackers often create a sense of **scarcity** by convincing the victim that an opportunity or resource is limited. For example, a phishing email might offer a fake financial reward or discount, but only if the recipient acts immediately. The fear of missing out (FOMO) leads victims to take hasty actions without verifying the legitimacy of the offer.

To defend against scarcity-based attacks, organizations should promote a culture of careful decision-making, encouraging users to double-check offers, especially those that seem "too good to be true."

---

### **Familiarity**

The principle of **familiarity** is based on trust. Attackers exploit this by impersonating someone the victim knows, like a coworker, friend, or family member. Phishing emails might be disguised as coming from a trusted colleague, or vishing calls may mimic familiar voices or personas. Because the victim recognizes the sender or caller, they are more likely to comply with requests without suspicion.

Ensuring employees verify communication from familiar sources, especially if the request is unusual or unexpected, is key to preventing familiarity-based attacks.

---

### **Authority**

Attackers may also exploit **authority** by pretending to be someone in a position of power, such as a CEO, government official, or IT administrator. This tactic works because individuals are conditioned to follow instructions from authority figures. For instance, a phishing email might appear to come from a high-ranking executive, requesting sensitive information or immediate action.

Organizations should establish verification protocols, where employees can confirm requests from authority figures, especially if they involve sensitive or financial data.

---

### **Urgency**

Creating a sense of **urgency** is one of the most common tactics in phishing and other social engineering attacks. The attacker pressures the victim to act immediately, claiming that failure to do so will result in severe consequences, such as a loss of access, financial penalties, or missed opportunities.

Training individuals to slow down and verify the legitimacy of urgent requests can drastically reduce the success rate of these attacks.

---

### **Periodic Content Reviews**

Technology and threats are constantly evolving, and security awareness programs must keep pace with these changes. Periodic reviews of training content are essential to address **emerging technologies and trends**, such as **cryptocurrency**, **artificial intelligence (AI)**, and **blockchain**. Keeping training content up to date ensures that employees are aware of new threats and how they might impact the organization.

---

#### **Evaluating Program Effectiveness**

Organizations must continuously evaluate the **effectiveness of their security awareness programs**. This can be done through metrics such as incident response times, reductions in successful phishing attacks, or employee participation in security training programs. Ongoing assessments ensure that training remains relevant and impactful, ultimately reducing human errors that can lead to security breaches.
